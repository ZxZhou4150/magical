# MAGICAL analysis

MAGICAL (Multiome Accessible Gene Integration Calling And Looping) is a hierarchical Bayesian approach that leverages paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from different conditions to map disease-associated transcription factors, chromatin sites, and genes as regulatory circuits. By simultaneously modeling signal variation across cells and conditions in both omics data types, MAGICAL achieved high accuracy on circuit inference. 

[R](https://github.com/Zxzhou4150/magical/tree/R-package) and [MATLAB](https://github.com/xichensf/magical/tree/main/MATLAB) scripts are provided for the use of MAGICAL with R v4.0.0 or MATLAB 2020a or later. The complete single cell data files are over 100GB and also the Bayesian learning process in MAGICAL may take hours to run on a local machine.

## Demo
Before working on a complete dataset, we suggest users to download [our demo dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CerwMHMnS1PNFNMy00OoHQjn6T30M1j4/view?usp=sharing) and go through the demo tutorial for analysis ([R markdown](tutorial/MAGICAL.Rmd) and the [html page](https://zxzhou4150.github.io/MAGICAL.html)) and visualization ([R markdown](tutorial/Visualization.Rmd) and the [html page](https://zxzhou4150.github.io/Visualization.html)) to get familiar with MAGICAL functions (running time ~15 mins in total).


## Human PBMC single cell multiomics data
The sample-paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data used in the MAGICAL paper have been deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession no. [GSE220190](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE220190).
